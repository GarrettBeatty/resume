This letter is being written to express my interest in the ``Software Development Engineer in Test" position located in New York.  With my current pursuit of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and my hands-on experience with software engineering, devops, and automation testing, I am sure that I would be a great asset to your organization.

%I enjoy being presented with a challenging project that forces me to get outside of my comfort zone and learn in a fast pace environment.  I am always looking for ways to learn new skills and technologies to help become a more successful developer.

Some important background about me that would allow for me to effectively contribute to the success of the organization is that I have previously built a machine learning infrastructure in Java and Python, that uses continuous integration and automation tools to ensure high quality and stable code. I was responsible for setting up Jenkins on our virtual machine, creating unit tests, and developing a pipeline to automatically monitor our codebase for bugs. I have also published an Android application that uses Travis CI and Fastlane to automatically build and deploy to the app store.

Attached in my application is my resume which details my past work experience and personal projects for software development.  I can be reached via cell phone at 856-905-6074 or by email at beattyg2@tcnj.edu.  Thank you for your time and I look forward to speaking to you about the position.
